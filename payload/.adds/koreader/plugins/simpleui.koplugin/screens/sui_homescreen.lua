-- screens/sui_homescreen.lua — built-in Homescreen identity and public API.
--
-- Rendering is generic in engines/sui_screen_engine.lua, which has no
-- opinion about "the built-in screen" — every screen (built-in or Custom)
-- supplies its own instance_cfg (id, pfx, layout_key, optional hooks) to the
-- engine's ScreenEngine._open(). This file is that supplier for the built-in
-- Homescreen (id "hs"); infra/sui_custom_screens.lua plays the same role
-- for Custom Screens.
--
-- IMPORTANT: mutates the SAME table returned by
-- require("engines/sui_screen_engine") instead of wrapping it in a new one.
-- main.lua, sui_patches.lua and several modules/*.lua read/write
-- ScreenEngine._instance, ._cached_books_state, etc. directly on this table,
-- and those fields double as the engine's flat legacy state store for
-- id == "hs" — returning a different table here would break that identity.
