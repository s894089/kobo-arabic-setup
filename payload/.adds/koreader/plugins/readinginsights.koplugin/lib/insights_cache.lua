Reading Insights - data cache for the insights view.

Everything the insights popup remembers between opens: the in-memory
per-minute/per-day caches, the "stale" copies that let the popup paint
last-known numbers instantly while fresh ones load in the background, the
"up to yesterday" base aggregates that keep a same-day refresh from
rescanning full history, the persisted finished-books lists behind the
reading-goal count, and the small settings file all of those are mirrored
to so they survive a KOReader restart.

This was lifted out of insights_view.lua unchanged in behaviour. The reason
is the same one behind lib/insights_settings.lua: Lua allows only 200 active
locals per function scope, and roughly 30 of them were being spent on cache
tables and helpers declared at the top level of the view. As fields on one
table they cost the view a single local instead.

Note that the tables are reassigned wholesale by M.clearAllCache() (the
title-bar "reload data" long press), which is exactly why every reference -
here and in the view - goes through M rather than through a local alias: an
alias would still point at the discarded table afterwards.

  M.ENABLE_CACHE               master switch; false = always hit the DB
  M.clearAllCache()            drop everything, including the stale copies
  M.loadDiskCache() / M.saveDiskCache()
                               mirror to/from the settings file on disk
  M.currentMinute() / M.todayDateStr()
                               the two cache stamps everything is keyed on
  M.getMinuteCache/setMinuteCache
                               per-minute read/write (+ stale mirror)
  M.getCachedBase/makeCachedBase
                               per-day "up to yesterday" base entries
  M.findStaleByPrefix/bestKnownFullResult
                               stale lookups for the prefix-keyed caches
  M.getCompletedYearly/getCompletedMonthly/setCompletedYearData
                               frozen year-specific data for past years,
                               served without a DB hit (see below)
