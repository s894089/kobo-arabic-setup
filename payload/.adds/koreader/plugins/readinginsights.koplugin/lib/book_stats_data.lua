Reading Insights - the data behind the book progress overlay.

One query, but the one that feeds most of the overlay: for a given book it
returns how many distinct days it has been read, today's pages and time for
that book, how long ago it was started, and when.

Split out of book_stats_view.lua so every popup in the plugin follows the
same shape - queries in lib/, widgets in views/ - and so this one is
reachable from a test without KOReader's UI. The rest of that view's numbers
come from lib/bookprogress.lua (positions and page counts) and
lib/chapterinfo.lua (chapters), which were already separate.

  BookStatsData.getBookAndTodayStats(book_id)
      -> total_days, today_pages, today_time,
         days_since_start, started_timestamp
