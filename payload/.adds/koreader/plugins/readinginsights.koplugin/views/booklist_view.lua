Reading Insights - the book list popups.

The list views the insights popup opens on a tap or a long press:

  - the books read in a given month/year/period (with the time spent on
    each),
  - the books that count towards the reading goal for a year,
  - the checklist for correcting that last list by hand, where a trailing
    "*" marks every book whose state the reader changed, and
  - the hand-kept list of books the statistics DB knows nothing about
    (read on paper, in another app, on another device), which counts
    towards the reading goal all the same - see lib/manual_books.lua.

The first two are read-only, and keep the KeyValuePage look they have
always had - with the same sort menu behind the title bar's left icon as
the editable ones (M.showSortMenu in widgets/booklistwidget.lua is shared
by both). The last two are the ones the reader edits, and are drawn by
widgets/booklistwidget.lua (a thin subclass of KOReader's SortWidget): a
sort menu behind the title bar's left icon (by last reading entry or by
title, each way round - last entry, newest first by default), a close "X"
on the right, paged rows with checkboxes where there's something to tick,
and a bottom bar with the page navigation plus a cancel "X" and an accept
check mark.

The read-only period lists replace the insights popup rather than stacking
on top of it: they close it, and reopen it with the same data when they
close. That needs the popup class, which would be a circular require - so
the view registers what's needed here instead, by calling M.bind() once at
load time. Calling any of these before bind() is a programming error, not a
runtime condition, so nothing here guards against it.
