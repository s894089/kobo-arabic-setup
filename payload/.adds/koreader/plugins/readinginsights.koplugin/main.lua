Reading Insights (plugin entry point)

This plugin adds two views, each implemented in its own file:

  insights_view.lua
    "Reading insights" - full-screen, scrollable reading-history popup
    (last week, streaks, yearly/monthly charts, all-time totals). Available
    everywhere (book view and file manager), via the Tools menu and via a
    general gesture/dispatcher action.

  book_stats_view.lua
    "Reading statistics: overview" - compact live overlay for the book
    currently open (chapter/book time left, progress, pace). Book-view only:
    it needs an open document, so it's only offered in the Tools menu while
    reading, and its gesture/dispatcher action only shows up for assignment
    under Reader gestures (not File manager gestures).

This file itself only does the wiring: it loads the shared translation
module (locale.lua) and both view modules, registers the two dispatcher
actions (for gesture/shortcut assignment), builds the Tools menu entries,
and forwards the two "show popup" events to the right view.

Both view files are loaded with loadfile()(...) rather than require(...)
so they don't depend on this plugin's directory being on package.path -
they get their dependencies passed in as one named table (see below).

The insights view's settings (lib/insights_settings.lua) and data cache
(lib/insights_cache.lua) are loaded here rather than from inside the view,
for two reasons: the Tools-menu entries built below and the view itself
then read and write one shared copy, and the view's own top-level local
count stays clear of Lua's 200-per-scope limit (see those files' headers).

Teaching KOReader's own core Screensaver module about the "readinginsights"
screensaver_type value, so that once it's selected in Settings > Screen >
Sleep screen, the core Power/Suspend codepath resolves it correctly on its
own - no runtime save-then-restore of screensaver_type spanning the actual
suspend/resume window, and therefore nothing that can be left stuck if a
session crashes mid-sleep.

Screensaver:setup() (called by core, straight off the raw Power/Suspend
input event, well before the "Suspend" event is ever broadcast to widgets)
normally just copies G_reader_settings' screensaver_type into
self.screensaver_type and resolves any fallbacks for a handful of
hardcoded values it knows about (e.g. "readingprogress" falling back to
"random_image" if the Statistics plugin isn't available - see core's own
screensaver.lua). It doesn't know "readinginsights", so left alone it
would just fall through every branch untouched.

This patch resolves our own value the same way core resolves its own
built-in ones, with one wrinkle: for the "book view falls back to Cover"
case, rather than reimplementing core's cover-mode resource setup
ourselves (image lookup, background mode, etc. - all internal to setup()),
it's simplest and most robust to let core's own logic do that work: swap
the *global* setting to "cover" for the duration of this single, synchronous
call to the original setup() (wrapped in pcall so the swap is always
undone, even if setup() itself errors), then put "readinginsights" straight
back before this function returns - well before "Suspend" is broadcast and
before the next suspend can possibly happen. That's a same-call-stack
round-trip, not a save-now/restore-later spanning an actual sleep, so
there's no crash-recovery bookkeeping needed the way the old override had.

Guarded by Screensaver._readinginsights_patched so re-instantiating this
plugin (book view + file manager both load it) only wraps setup() once.

Only applies to plain suspend (event == nil): poweroff/reboot use their
own separate sleep-screen resolution in core, which this plugin has never
hooked into and still doesn't.

Add "Reading insights" as a genuine selectable entry directly inside
KOReader's own Settings > Screen > Sleep screen > Wallpaper radio group
(alongside "Document cover", "Random image", etc.), instead of only
inside this plugin's own Tools menu.

Core builds that submenu like this (readermenu.lua / filemanagermenu.lua):

    if Device:supportsScreensaver() then
        local screensaver_sub_item_table = dofile("frontend/ui/elements/screensaver_menu.lua")
        ...
        self.menu_items.screensaver = { ..., sub_item_table = screensaver_sub_item_table }
    end

Note it's dofile(), not require() - core deliberately re-executes that
file fresh every time the menu is (re)built, rather than caching it as a
module. That means we can't reach the finished menu_items.screensaver
table reliably from our own addToMainMenu() (its presence there depends
on load order between plugins, which isn't guaranteed - see this
version's changelog/commit message for the concrete failure this used to
hit). What we *can* do reliably is hook the dofile() call itself: wrap the
global dofile so that, only for this one specific path, the table it
returns gets our entry appended before core ever touches it. That
guarantees our entry is baked into menu_items.screensaver.sub_item_table
itself, however and whenever core assembles it - no dependence on plugin
order at all.

If a device build never calls dofile() on that path in the first place
(Device:supportsScreensaver() returning false - a real, documented
KOReader limitation on some devices/platforms, unrelated to this plugin -
see e.g. koreader/koreader issues #13877, #14139, #2198), this patch
simply never fires, same as core's own Sleep screen menu never appearing
for that device either. The Tools > Reading insights > Settings > "Use as
sleep screen" quick toggle remains available either way.

            ("Document cover", "Random image", "Leave screen as-is", etc.,
            all built via that file's local genMenuItem() helper, which

            `result` (the old approach) therefore landed our entry as a
            sibling of "Wallpaper" itself, one level too high.

            So: walk `result`'s entries looking for the first one whose own

            currently "Leave screen as-is" - with separator = true to draw
            the divider before the non-radio settings below it). That keeps
            "Reading insights" grouped with the other wallpaper choices and

Sleep-screen integration.

"Reading insights" is a genuine selectable entry in KOReader's own
Settings > Screen > Sleep screen menu (see addToMainMenu() below), backed
by patchCoreScreensaver() teaching core's Screensaver module to recognize
it. Core's own Screensaver:show() (which runs off the raw Power/Suspend
input event, before the "Suspend" event below is even broadcast) already
resolved screensaver_type == "disable" for this case by the time we get
here - see patchCoreScreensaver() - so it painted nothing, and this is
free to show the actual popup without racing or flashing against it.

The popup is created with readonly = true so a stray tap, swipe-down, or
the wake key itself can't dismiss it early while the device is still
"asleep"; onResume below is what actually closes it again.

-- Everything the menu module needs beyond the plugin instance itself: the
-- views it opens dialogs for, the settings modules its toggles read and
-- write, and the two sleep-screen helpers that live here because the
-- screensaver integration around them does too.
